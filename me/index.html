                    <p>I think VideoGames are the most powerfull media in the world right now, with the capacity of tell storys of an amazing way. Definetly the 7th Art. Anyways here is a list of games I like :)</p>
                    <ul>
                <header class="games-definition-header">
                    <h3>Casual games</h3>
                </header>
                        <li><strong> Hollow knight / Silksong</strong></li>
                        <p>These games are absolute Masterpiece of the VideoGames in general. imo the bests Metroidvanias in the market, 100% recommended.</p>
                        
                        <li><strong>Persona 3R/4G/5R</strong></li>
                        <p>What a trylogy no? my pass in this games was an incredible experience, i never thought that i would cry for Shinjiro and Makoto in P3R, or how much empathy I developed in P4G, while I completed Nanako's dungeon, or how much I will question the authority and the stablished dogmas and society morals with P5R, every single of this games are an absolute recommend to play, I know that every single one of this games last long aprox 80hrs but its every damn minute worth...</p>

                        <li><strong> SatisFactory</strong></li>
                        <p>Adicted? n-no, What are you talking about. OF COURSE I'm Adicted to this game, It is the deffinition of dopamine, solving an issue neither with electricity or resourse optimization, this game will reward you with the strongest drug available, SATISFACTION. So you must be very carefull playing this game, because when you less expected, you will have 60 hrs played in less than a week.</p>

                        <li><strong> Alan wake</strong></li>
                        <p>Get me out of this dark place???   An incredible videogame that feels amazing to play, a rich story, amazing mechanics and for the years it have, it feels like a AA game of today. In my books Alan Wake is a BEAST of character and story desing. No less expected from Alan Wake, AKA: The Champion of the Light </p>

                    <h3>Competitive games</h3>
                </header>
                        <li><strong>League of Legends</strong></li>
                        <p>Actually I'm retired of LoL, but my history with this game is a very strange one, back in 2019 a friend told me, 'Hey, we should play League 2gether', I always refused and say League is a Losers game, then 2020 pandemic hits. the same friend told me 'wanna give it a try', the worst mistake of my lifee, this game drained my whole life, I keep playing untill dicember of 2025, I played my whole highschool and 2 years of University. I would like to say This game was a sh*t for me. But the truth is not. League stayed with me when I most needed, I knew new people that I can proudly say they are my friends. Also my OTP was Master Yi[1.3M] and Kayn[990k]</p>

                        <li><strong>Counter-Strike</strong></li>
                        <p>Currently playing Cs2, I really like shooters, cs:go was my first competitive game I tried, back then I had a potato pc and was the only thing I managed to Run in my pc. #bringbackCSGO</p>

                        <li><strong>Dead by Daylight</strong></li>
                        <p>What a game. Kaneki main, i REally like play kaneki, if I dont play kaneki I feel bad, you can hate all you can. but nothing will make me NOT love Kaneki.</p>
